I'll help make those changes. Here are the necessary *TARGET/REPLACE* blocks:

1. First, update the favorite number to 5 in main.py:
```py
main.py
<<<<<<< TARGET
fav_number = 1
=======
fav_number = 5
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

2. Then add a second print statement to show the number one higher than the favorite number:
```py
main.py
<<<<<<< TARGET
    print("My favourite number is", fav_number)
=======
    print("My favourite number is", fav_number)
    print("One higher than my favourite number is", fav_number + 1)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

3. Finally, update the README.md to reflect these changes:
```markdown
docs/README.md
<<<<<<< TARGET
This is my program
=======
This is my favorite number program. It displays:
- My favorite number (5)
- The number one higher than my favorite number (6)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
