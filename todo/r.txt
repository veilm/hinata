the docs haven't been updated since
	vm fa85c9e15777ad48b4cb88f18304aa047ff7756e

you should use find_docs.py and the diff

like make find_docs.py create a simple output of deps


"path/to/OrderList.tsx changed
	so X, which abstracts OrderList.tsx, may require changes

if X changed, Y may require changes

if Y changed, Z may require changes"
etc., something reasonable


then you basically give it all the files at once including the diff, and tell it
to make any changes
idk, or do them one at a time
haven't thought it through yet
