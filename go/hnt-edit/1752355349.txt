**Initiating Calculator Design**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
I'm starting the process of building a command-line calculator in Python. The core functionality will include basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. My initial step is creating the `0.py` file, which is currently empty.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      **Planning the Calculator's Core**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
I've made significant progress by outlining the fundamental structure. I plan to define separate functions for each operation. Following that, I'll implement a main loop to manage user interactions, handling both input and output. I've also identified error handling and exiting mechanisms as crucial components. My `0.py` file will now contain the basic calculator structure, and I will write code there.

I've just finished implementing the fundamental functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Furthermore, I have successfully integrated a main loop that manages user interaction for operation selection and number input, complete with error handling to manage invalid input. The next thing I'll add is the 'yes/no' option for the user to continue calculations.

I've reviewed the provided plan and example code. I will now implement the code in `0.py`, replicating the functionality of the example with error handling and user interaction. After incorporating the provided code and handling the initial file creation, I'll refine the calculator's logic.

As Hinata Edit, I'd be happy to write a simple calculator for you. I'll create a Python script that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.
