User advised against 'ls -R' and recommended reading project markdown files. I'll read HINATA.md, README.md, and agent/HINATA.md to get context, then use 'fd' to explore the source.
Read project docs. Now understand the C->Python->App architecture. Plan is to replicate the hnt-agent loop in Rust. First, using 'fd' to map out the Python reference files and the new Rust crate structure.
User corrected my location. The Rust code is in a 'rust' subdirectory. Changing directory to '/home/oboro/src/hinata/rust' and will re-attempt to explore the project structure with 'fd'.
Previous 'fd' command failed to exclude 'research' and list Rust files. Now running a corrected 'fd' command to properly list both the Rust project files and the Python reference files, excluding irrelevant directories.
Struggling with 'fd' to list both rust and python files. Switching strategy: I will list the Rust project structure first with 'fd .', then analyze the key Python files to understand the reference implementation.
Mapped out the Rust project structure. Now focusing on the reference Python implementation. I will read 'hnt-agent.py' and 'hnt-shell-apply.py' to understand the core agent loop and shell command execution logic before starting the Rust port.
Analyzed Python agent scripts. Plan is to port the logic to Rust. Before coding the agent, I need to understand the APIs of the Rust libraries. Now reading the source for 'hinata-core' and 'headlesh' to see their public interfaces.
Identified that `headlesh::exec` doesn't capture output, which is a blocker. My first task is to modify `bins/headlesh/src/lib.rs` using `hnt-edit` to add a new `exec_captured` function that returns stdout, stderr, and the exit code.
The 'headlesh' library has been updated with 'exec_captured'. Now compiling the entire Rust project to validate the changes before I begin implementing the agent's main logic in 'bins/hnt-agent/src/main.rs'.
Build successful. The unreachable code warning is expected. Now inspecting the skeleton code in 'bins/hnt-agent/src/main.rs' before I begin implementing the full agent logic.
Starting implementation of the core agent logic in 'main.rs'. I'll add the priming sequence, modify the main loop to use 'exec_captured', format the output into an XML structure, and handle the case of no shell command. Using 'hnt-edit' to apply these changes.
Build failed due to type mismatches in the format! macro. I'm now fixing 'main.rs' to correctly handle the output from 'exec_captured'. I will convert the stdout/stderr byte vectors to strings using from_utf8_lossy and extract the integer from the ExitStatus.
The type mismatch in the `format!` macro has been fixed. I'm now recompiling the project to verify the fix and prepare for a test run of the agent.
Compilation failed again due to a type mismatch. The `exec_captured` function returns Strings, not byte vectors. I am now using `hnt-edit` to remove the unnecessary `String::from_utf8_lossy` wrappers in `main.rs`.
The `String::from_utf8_lossy` wrappers have been removed to fix the previous build error. I am now compiling the project again to verify the fix before running the first test of the `hnt-agent`.
The build is successful. I am now running the first end-to-end test of the `hnt-agent` by instructing it to list the files in the current directory.
Successfully ported the hnt-agent from Python to Rust. The core functionality is implemented and has passed its first end-to-end test. I've documented the new execution flow.
User pointed out I should check existing dependencies before adding new ones. Now inspecting the Cargo.toml files for `hnt-agent` and the workspace root to identify the current logging library.
No standard logger found in `hnt-agent` or root `Cargo.toml`. Recalling `headlesh` uses one, I'll check its source and dependencies to maintain logging consistency across the project.
Discovered `headlesh` uses `simplelog`. I'll adopt it for `hnt-agent` to implement verbose logging. Plan: add dependencies, a `--verbose` flag, conditional logger initialization, and replace `eprintln`s with `log` macros. Starting with dependencies now.
Dependencies for logging are added. Now modifying `hnt-agent` to use them. I'll add a `--verbose` flag, initialize `simplelog` conditionally, and replace trace `eprintlns` with `log::debug!` macros using `hnt-edit`.
Verbose logging feature implemented. Now compiling to verify changes. Next, I'll run tests with and without the `--verbose` flag to confirm functionality.
Build succeeded. Testing now. First, running without `--verbose` to confirm clean stderr output.
Initial test passed: no debug logs without the verbose flag. Now, re-running with `--verbose` to confirm that the debug output appears as expected.

Creating a structured TODO list in /tmp/TODO.md to track feature parity tasks for the Rust hnt-agent port.
User wants native Rust implementations, not subprocesses. I will now find the existing TUI library in the project by inspecting Cargo.toml files before implementing the interactive confirmation.
Identified 'hnt-tui' as the native TUI library. Now exploring its source code to understand its API before adding it as a dependency to hnt-agent.
Discovered 'hnt-tui' is a binary, not a library. I will now examine its main.rs and Cargo.toml to understand its functionality and dependencies to determine how to implement native TUI features in hnt-agent.
User directed to use native Rust TUI. Updating TODO to refactor hnt-tui into a library, then will use hnt-edit to perform the refactoring.
Refactoring hnt-tui crate. I'll use hnt-edit to move the TUI logic into a new lib.rs, make key components public, update main.rs to use the library, and adjust Cargo.toml for a dual lib/bin crate.
hnt-tui refactoring is complete. Now updating the TODO list and compiling the workspace to verify the changes before integrating the new TUI library into hnt-agent.
Adding hnt-tui as a dependency to hnt-agent to enable native TUI confirmation prompts.
Added hnt-tui dependency. Now updating the TODO list.
Implementing interactive confirmation in hnt-agent's main.rs using hnt-tui, including handling user choices and creating a reusable function for new instructions.
