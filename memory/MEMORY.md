Starting task: modify hnt-agent to use a TUI pane for user input. First, I will explore the codebase.
Exploring `hnt-agent` to find where it handles user input and argument parsing.
Starting to investigate how hnt-agent invokes the editor. I will search for relevant keywords in bins/hnt-agent.
Found the editor invocation in `get_input_from_editor` in `bins/hnt-agent/src/main.rs`. Now checking for arg parser and `hnt-tui pane` usage.
Confirmed clap is used. Now checking 'hnt-tui pane' help before modifying hnt-agent to add the --use-pane flag and conditional editor invocation.
Ready to modify hnt-agent. I will use hnt-edit to add the --use-pane flag and modify get_input_from_editor to use `hnt-tui pane` when the flag is active.
Code has been modified by hnt-edit. Now building the project to verify the changes.
User requested not to use build.sh. Running 'cargo build' instead to verify compilation after the recent changes.
