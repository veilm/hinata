Starting the project. First, I'll examine the Python code in ./agent to understand its functionality. Listing the files in tha directory.
Found hnt-agent.py. Reading its contents, plus the README and HINATA markdown files for context on the agent.
Understood the Python agent's role as an orchestrator. Now exploring the existing `./rust` codebase to identify reusable components before starting the rewrite. Listing the contents of the directory.
Found a standard Rust workspace. I'll read Cargo.toml to understand the project structure and dependencies, then explore the `bins` and `crates` directories.
The Cargo.toml confirms an existing `hnt-agent` crate. I'll now examine its contents to assess the current state of the rewrite before exploring the `hinata-core` shared crate.
Inspecting `hnt-agent` crate. I'll check its Cargo.toml for dependencies, then the source code in `src/main.rs` to see what is already implemented.
Dependencies for hnt-agent (`hinata-core`, `clap`, `anyhow`, `tokio`) look good. Now I'll examine the `src/main.rs` file to assess the current implementation status.
The Rust hnt-agent is a placeholder. I will implement the full logic, starting by exploring the `hinata-core` crate to see what utility functions are available for use.
Examining `hinata-core` to understand its modules. I'll read `lib.rs` first to see the public API, followed by `chat.rs` to understand chat management.
The `hinata-core::chat` module replaces `hnt-chat` CLI calls. I will now use `hnt-edit` to scaffold the `hnt-agent`'s main.rs with `clap` argument parsing and the main application structure, using the Python script as a blueprint.
Scaffolding for `main.rs` is complete. Now compiling and running the `hnt-agent` with sample arguments to test the `clap` parser.
User feedback prompted a refined architectural plan. I'll read HINATA.md, then aim for tight integration by using library APIs for hnt-chat and headlesh, absorbing hnt-shell-apply's logic into hnt-agent, and limiting command execution to external tools like tui-select.
With a clear architectural goal to use in-process calls, I will now investigate the `headlesh` crate's library API by inspecting its source directory to enable its integration into `hnt-agent`.
Correcting my previous path error and noting the internal Rust TUI tools. I will now inspect the `headlesh` crate's source at the correct path to understand its API for direct integration.
Repeatedly failing to find the `headlesh` crate. I need to re-orient myself. Listing the contents of `rust/bins` to get a correct understanding of the project structure.
I have been making repeated pathing errors. I am lost. Re-orienting myself by listing the contents of the current directory (`rust`) to understand the actual project structure.
I've re-oriented myself within the `rust` directory. I now see the `bins`/`crates` structure. I will proceed to inspect the `headlesh` source code located in `bins/headlesh` to understand its API.
The `headlesh` crate is binary-only. I need to refactor it to expose a library for `hnt-agent`. I'll start by reading `bins/headlesh/src/main.rs` to identify core logic for extraction.
Refactoring `headlesh` into a library. I will use `hnt-edit` to create a `lib.rs`, extract the daemon logic out of `main.rs`, define a public API, and update `Cargo.toml`.
The first refactoring phase of `headlesh` is complete. I'll now verify the changes by compiling the crate and running tests, followed by manually testing the `list` command.
Build passed, no tests exist. Manually testing the `list` command of the refactored CLI.
Client-side refactor of `headlesh` is confirmed working. Now, I'll re-integrate the daemonization logic. I'll move the daemon code into a private `run_daemon` function within `lib.rs`, expose it via a public `Session::spawn()`, and update the `create` command to use this new function. I'll use `hnt-edit` for this.
Daemonization logic has been refactored into the `headlesh` library. Compiling the crate now to verify the changes.
The `hnt-edit` refactor introduced compilation errors in `headlesh`. I'll use `hnt-edit` again to fix them, addressing the incorrect `daemonize` API usage and the async file handle issue with `tokio::process::Command`.
The daemonize and async stdio fixes have been applied. I'll now rebuild the `headlesh` crate to verify the corrections.
The previous `stdio` fix failed. The compiler error indicates a type resolution issue within the `match` statement. I will be more explicit: I'll bind the `await` result to a variable before calling `.into_std()` to ensure correct type inference for the command builder.
The previous `hnt-edit` attempt failed. The issue is a type mismatch between `tokio::fs::File` and `std::process::Stdio`. I will retry `hnt-edit` with explicit instructions to `.await` the file opening, unwrap it, and then call `.into_std()` to get the correct handle type.
The refactoring by `hnt-edit` to use an explicit async block and the `?` operator seems to have fixed the issue. I will now build `headlesh` to confirm.
Stuck on a compile error due to I/O redirection complexity. I'm abandoning the current approach and reverting to the original, simpler strategy. I'll use `hnt-edit` to modify `run_daemon` to use shell-level redirection via a temporary script, thus bypassing the problematic file handle code in Rust.
Confident that reverting to shell-based redirection fixed the build, I will now compile the `headlesh` crate one last time.
User found a critical bug in `headlesh`: `create` is silent and `list` doesn't work. My hypothesis is a silent daemon failure. I will investigate by checking the daemon's log files for session '0' to diagnose the problem.
User feedback indicates no log file is created for new sessions. This suggests a failure in `Session::spawn` before logging is initialized. I'll add the necessary log directory creation to `Session::create` to fix this.
Log directory creation moved to `Session::create`. Compiling `headlesh`, then testing `create` and `list` commands with a new session ID to verify the fix.
The `create` command succeeded, but `list` still fails to show the new session, indicating a persistent daemon failure. I will now check the newly created log file for errors.
The `headlesh` daemon is failing before logging starts. The issue is likely in `Session::spawn` or the lack of logger initialization. I will use `hnt-edit` to re-add `simplelog` setup and error handling to `run_daemon` to diagnose the problem.
Logger initialization is back in `run_daemon`. I'll compile, create a new session, and check the log file for errors if it fails.
Daemon fails before logging. I suspect the `daemonize.start()` call is misconfigured. Original code used `working_directory`, but my refactor removed it. I'll re-add it to `Session::spawn` which I believe will fix the issue.
The `working_directory` call was likely the missing piece. I'll compile, then run `create` and `list` to confirm that `test-session-3` is now created and visible.
The `working_directory` fix failed to resolve silent daemon failures. Logging isn't working, so I can't see the error. I'll use `hnt-edit` to add crude, hardcoded file logging to the daemon's earliest execution stage to confirm if the process is even running.
Added crude logging as a last resort. I'll compile, create a session, then check `/tmp/headlesh_debug.log` to see if `run_daemon` is executing.
The daemon's failure to launch, despite fixes, points to an issue with forking within a `tokio::main` runtime. I will use `hnt-edit` to refactor `headlesh`'s `main.rs`, removing the `#[tokio::main]` macro and manually managing the Tokio runtime to ensure the forked child process can create its own clean runtime instance.
The `tokio::main` conflict should now be resolved. I'll compile `headlesh` and run a full integration test: create, list, exec, and exit to confirm stability.
The `headlesh` daemon is still failing due to a Tokio runtime issue in the forked process. The fix is to make the daemon's logic fully synchronous. I will use `hnt-edit` to refactor `run_daemon` to use `std` threads and blocking I/O, removing all Tokio dependencies from the forked code.
After extensive debugging, `headlesh` daemon logic is now fully synchronous. I am confident this is the correct approach. Now running the full `headlesh` integration test.
The `headlesh` integration test passed. The refactoring is complete. I will now remove the unused import from `headlesh/src/lib.rs`.
With the `headlesh` crate now stable, I'm resuming the `hnt-agent` implementation. I'll use `hnt-edit` to integrate `headlesh` session creation and a `Drop` guard for cleanup into `main.rs`.
User found a critical `headlesh` regression: shell state isn't persisting. My `run_daemon` refactor incorrectly spawns a new shell for each command. I will now refactor `run_daemon` to spawn a single, long-lived shell and pipe commands to its stdin, restoring state persistence.
The `headlesh` stateful functionality is restored. I'll remove the debug cruft, then run the full integration test to confirm the fix.
Debug code removed. Running final integration test to validate `headlesh` stability and correctness.
User correctly pointed out my proposed `headlesh` fix introduces a shell injection vulnerability. The temp file approach is correct for robustness; the bug is a race condition. I will stop and analyze the original C implementation of `headlesh` to understand the correct, safe way to execute commands before attempting another fix.
Understood the correct `headlesh` execution logic from the C implementation. The shell, not the server, must delete the temporary script. I will modify `run_daemon` in Rust to use `NamedTempFile::into_path()` and construct a one-liner command that sources the script, performs redirections, and then calls `rm -f` on the script path.
Understood the task. The 'headlesh' library has been refactored but is unstable. My first step is to attempt compilation of the headlesh crate, as instructed, and analyze any errors. I will not test manually.
Understood that headlesh is unstable after its refactor into a library. My immediate task is to get it to compile. Correcting the path to its source code and then proceeding with a build.
Compilation of headlesh failed due to an incorrect method name for NamedTempFile. Using hnt-edit to change `into_path()` to the correct `into_temp_path()`.
hnt-edit failed due to an incorrect relative path. I'm already in the 'rust' directory. Retrying the edit with the correct path 'bins/headlesh/src/lib.rs'.
User reports race condition in headlesh where temp script is deleted before execution. My previous fix was wrong. The correct fix is to use `std::mem::forget` on the TempPath guard to prevent Rust from deleting the file, leaving cleanup to the shell.
Applied the std::mem::forget fix for the headlesh race condition. Now recompiling and waiting for user to re-test.
