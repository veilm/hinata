User advised against 'ls -R' and recommended reading project markdown files. I'll read HINATA.md, README.md, and agent/HINATA.md to get context, then use 'fd' to explore the source.
Read project docs. Now understand the C->Python->App architecture. Plan is to replicate the hnt-agent loop in Rust. First, using 'fd' to map out the Python reference files and the new Rust crate structure.
User corrected my location. The Rust code is in a 'rust' subdirectory. Changing directory to '/home/oboro/src/hinata/rust' and will re-attempt to explore the project structure with 'fd'.
Previous 'fd' command failed to exclude 'research' and list Rust files. Now running a corrected 'fd' command to properly list both the Rust project files and the Python reference files, excluding irrelevant directories.
Struggling with 'fd' to list both rust and python files. Switching strategy: I will list the Rust project structure first with 'fd .', then analyze the key Python files to understand the reference implementation.
Mapped out the Rust project structure. Now focusing on the reference Python implementation. I will read 'hnt-agent.py' and 'hnt-shell-apply.py' to understand the core agent loop and shell command execution logic before starting the Rust port.
Analyzed Python agent scripts. Plan is to port the logic to Rust. Before coding the agent, I need to understand the APIs of the Rust libraries. Now reading the source for 'hinata-core' and 'headlesh' to see their public interfaces.
Identified that `headlesh::exec` doesn't capture output, which is a blocker. My first task is to modify `bins/headlesh/src/lib.rs` using `hnt-edit` to add a new `exec_captured` function that returns stdout, stderr, and the exit code.
The 'headlesh' library has been updated with 'exec_captured'. Now compiling the entire Rust project to validate the changes before I begin implementing the agent's main logic in 'bins/hnt-agent/src/main.rs'.
Build successful. The unreachable code warning is expected. Now inspecting the skeleton code in 'bins/hnt-agent/src/main.rs' before I begin implementing the full agent logic.
Starting implementation of the core agent logic in 'main.rs'. I'll add the priming sequence, modify the main loop to use 'exec_captured', format the output into an XML structure, and handle the case of no shell command. Using 'hnt-edit' to apply these changes.
Build failed due to type mismatches in the format! macro. I'm now fixing 'main.rs' to correctly handle the output from 'exec_captured'. I will convert the stdout/stderr byte vectors to strings using from_utf8_lossy and extract the integer from the ExitStatus.
The type mismatch in the `format!` macro has been fixed. I'm now recompiling the project to verify the fix and prepare for a test run of the agent.
Compilation failed again due to a type mismatch. The `exec_captured` function returns Strings, not byte vectors. I am now using `hnt-edit` to remove the unnecessary `String::from_utf8_lossy` wrappers in `main.rs`.
The `String::from_utf8_lossy` wrappers have been removed to fix the previous build error. I am now compiling the project again to verify the fix before running the first test of the `hnt-agent`.
The build is successful. I am now running the first end-to-end test of the `hnt-agent` by instructing it to list the files in the current directory.
