Starting the project. First, I'll examine the Python code in ./agent to understand its functionality. Listing the files in tha directory.
Found hnt-agent.py. Reading its contents, plus the README and HINATA markdown files for context on the agent.
Understood the Python agent's role as an orchestrator. Now exploring the existing `./rust` codebase to identify reusable components before starting the rewrite. Listing the contents of the directory.
Found a standard Rust workspace. I'll read Cargo.toml to understand the project structure and dependencies, then explore the `bins` and `crates` directories.
The Cargo.toml confirms an existing `hnt-agent` crate. I'll now examine its contents to assess the current state of the rewrite before exploring the `hinata-core` shared crate.
Inspecting `hnt-agent` crate. I'll check its Cargo.toml for dependencies, then the source code in `src/main.rs` to see what is already implemented.
Dependencies for hnt-agent (`hinata-core`, `clap`, `anyhow`, `tokio`) look good. Now I'll examine the `src/main.rs` file to assess the current implementation status.
The Rust hnt-agent is a placeholder. I will implement the full logic, starting by exploring the `hinata-core` crate to see what utility functions are available for use.
Examining `hinata-core` to understand its modules. I'll read `lib.rs` first to see the public API, followed by `chat.rs` to understand chat management.
The `hinata-core::chat` module replaces `hnt-chat` CLI calls. I will now use `hnt-edit` to scaffold the `hnt-agent`'s main.rs with `clap` argument parsing and the main application structure, using the Python script as a blueprint.
Scaffolding for `main.rs` is complete. Now compiling and running the `hnt-agent` with sample arguments to test the `clap` parser.
