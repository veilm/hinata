Starting task: modify hnt-agent to use a TUI pane for user input. First, I will explore the codebase.
Exploring `hnt-agent` to find where it handles user input and argument parsing.
Starting to investigate how hnt-agent invokes the editor. I will search for relevant keywords in bins/hnt-agent.
Found the editor invocation in `get_input_from_editor` in `bins/hnt-agent/src/main.rs`. Now checking for arg parser and `hnt-tui pane` usage.
Confirmed clap is used. Now checking 'hnt-tui pane' help before modifying hnt-agent to add the --use-pane flag and conditional editor invocation.
Ready to modify hnt-agent. I will use hnt-edit to add the --use-pane flag and modify get_input_from_editor to use `hnt-tui pane` when the flag is active.
Code has been modified by hnt-edit. Now building the project to verify the changes.
User requested not to use build.sh. Running 'cargo build' instead to verify compilation after the recent changes.
Explaining Rust workspace conventions (bins/ vs crates/) to the user. Will show the top-level Cargo.toml to illustrate.
User wants to flatten src/ directories. I will investigate headlesh/Cargo.toml and its file structure to explain the implications.
User has approved the project flattening. I will now proceed with moving packages from bins/ and crates/ to the root, renaming hinata-core, and updating all necessary Cargo.toml files.
Refactoring is done. Now verifying the changes by checking the main Cargo.toml and running 'cargo check' on the entire workspace.
The refactoring caused a build error. My previous `sed` command to update dependency paths failed. I will now inspect `hnt-agent/Cargo.toml` to diagnose the issue and create a new command to fix it.
The previous path fix was incomplete. Sibling dependencies also have incorrect paths. I will use hnt-edit to correct all local dependency paths in every Cargo.toml file in the workspace.
Previous hnt-edit failed due to an incorrect fd command. I am now correcting the file search and clarifying the instructions to fix the broken dependency paths in all Cargo.toml files.
Previous attempts to fix paths with hnt-edit failed due to incorrect file searching. I am now using a more reliable `find` command and a focused prompt to correct only the broken `hinata-core` dependency path.
The dependency paths have been corrected by hnt-edit. I will now run 'cargo check' again to finally verify the refactoring.
