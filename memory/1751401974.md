Starting the project. First, I'll examine the Python code in ./agent to understand its functionality. Listing the files in tha directory.
Found hnt-agent.py. Reading its contents, plus the README and HINATA markdown files for context on the agent.
Understood the Python agent's role as an orchestrator. Now exploring the existing `./rust` codebase to identify reusable components before starting the rewrite. Listing the contents of the directory.
Found a standard Rust workspace. I'll read Cargo.toml to understand the project structure and dependencies, then explore the `bins` and `crates` directories.
The Cargo.toml confirms an existing `hnt-agent` crate. I'll now examine its contents to assess the current state of the rewrite before exploring the `hinata-core` shared crate.
Inspecting `hnt-agent` crate. I'll check its Cargo.toml for dependencies, then the source code in `src/main.rs` to see what is already implemented.
Dependencies for hnt-agent (`hinata-core`, `clap`, `anyhow`, `tokio`) look good. Now I'll examine the `src/main.rs` file to assess the current implementation status.
The Rust hnt-agent is a placeholder. I will implement the full logic, starting by exploring the `hinata-core` crate to see what utility functions are available for use.
Examining `hinata-core` to understand its modules. I'll read `lib.rs` first to see the public API, followed by `chat.rs` to understand chat management.
The `hinata-core::chat` module replaces `hnt-chat` CLI calls. I will now use `hnt-edit` to scaffold the `hnt-agent`'s main.rs with `clap` argument parsing and the main application structure, using the Python script as a blueprint.
Scaffolding for `main.rs` is complete. Now compiling and running the `hnt-agent` with sample arguments to test the `clap` parser.
User feedback prompted a refined architectural plan. I'll read HINATA.md, then aim for tight integration by using library APIs for hnt-chat and headlesh, absorbing hnt-shell-apply's logic into hnt-agent, and limiting command execution to external tools like tui-select.
With a clear architectural goal to use in-process calls, I will now investigate the `headlesh` crate's library API by inspecting its source directory to enable its integration into `hnt-agent`.
Correcting my previous path error and noting the internal Rust TUI tools. I will now inspect the `headlesh` crate's source at the correct path to understand its API for direct integration.
Repeatedly failing to find the `headlesh` crate. I need to re-orient myself. Listing the contents of `rust/bins` to get a correct understanding of the project structure.
I have been making repeated pathing errors. I am lost. Re-orienting myself by listing the contents of the current directory (`rust`) to understand the actual project structure.
I've re-oriented myself within the `rust` directory. I now see the `bins`/`crates` structure. I will proceed to inspect the `headlesh` source code located in `bins/headlesh` to understand its API.
The `headlesh` crate is binary-only. I need to refactor it to expose a library for `hnt-agent`. I'll start by reading `bins/headlesh/src/main.rs` to identify core logic for extraction.
Refactoring `headlesh` into a library. I will use `hnt-edit` to create a `lib.rs`, extract the daemon logic out of `main.rs`, define a public API, and update `Cargo.toml`.
The first refactoring phase of `headlesh` is complete. I'll now verify the changes by compiling the crate and running tests, followed by manually testing the `list` command.
Build passed, no tests exist. Manually testing the `list` command of the refactored CLI.
Client-side refactor of `headlesh` is confirmed working. Now, I'll re-integrate the daemonization logic. I'll move the daemon code into a private `run_daemon` function within `lib.rs`, expose it via a public `Session::spawn()`, and update the `create` command to use this new function. I'll use `hnt-edit` for this.
Daemonization logic has been refactored into the `headlesh` library. Compiling the crate now to verify the changes.
The `hnt-edit` refactor introduced compilation errors in `headlesh`. I'll use `hnt-edit` again to fix them, addressing the incorrect `daemonize` API usage and the async file handle issue with `tokio::process::Command`.
The daemonize and async stdio fixes have been applied. I'll now rebuild the `headlesh` crate to verify the corrections.
The previous `stdio` fix failed. The compiler error indicates a type resolution issue within the `match` statement. I will be more explicit: I'll bind the `await` result to a variable before calling `.into_std()` to ensure correct type inference for the command builder.
The previous `hnt-edit` attempt failed. The issue is a type mismatch between `tokio::fs::File` and `std::process::Stdio`. I will retry `hnt-edit` with explicit instructions to `.await` the file opening, unwrap it, and then call `.into_std()` to get the correct handle type.
The refactoring by `hnt-edit` to use an explicit async block and the `?` operator seems to have fixed the issue. I will now build `headlesh` to confirm.
Stuck on a compile error due to I/O redirection complexity. I'm abandoning the current approach and reverting to the original, simpler strategy. I'll use `hnt-edit` to modify `run_daemon` to use shell-level redirection via a temporary script, thus bypassing the problematic file handle code in Rust.
Confident that reverting to shell-based redirection fixed the build, I will now compile the `headlesh` crate one last time.
User found a critical bug in `headlesh`: `create` is silent and `list` doesn't work. My hypothesis is a silent daemon failure. I will investigate by checking the daemon's log files for session '0' to diagnose the problem.
User feedback indicates no log file is created for new sessions. This suggests a failure in `Session::spawn` before logging is initialized. I'll add the necessary log directory creation to `Session::create` to fix this.
Log directory creation moved to `Session::create`. Compiling `headlesh`, then testing `create` and `list` commands with a new session ID to verify the fix.
The `create` command succeeded, but `list` still fails to show the new session, indicating a persistent daemon failure. I will now check the newly created log file for errors.
The `headlesh` daemon is failing before logging starts. The issue is likely in `Session::spawn` or the lack of logger initialization. I will use `hnt-edit` to re-add `simplelog` setup and error handling to `run_daemon` to diagnose the problem.
Logger initialization is back in `run_daemon`. I'll compile, create a new session, and check the log file for errors if it fails.
Daemon fails before logging. I suspect the `daemonize.start()` call is misconfigured. Original code used `working_directory`, but my refactor removed it. I'll re-add it to `Session::spawn` which I believe will fix the issue.
The `working_directory` call was likely the missing piece. I'll compile, then run `create` and `list` to confirm that `test-session-3` is now created and visible.
The `working_directory` fix failed to resolve silent daemon failures. Logging isn't working, so I can't see the error. I'll use `hnt-edit` to add crude, hardcoded file logging to the daemon's earliest execution stage to confirm if the process is even running.
Added crude logging as a last resort. I'll compile, create a session, then check `/tmp/headlesh_debug.log` to see if `run_daemon` is executing.
The daemon's failure to launch, despite fixes, points to an issue with forking within a `tokio::main` runtime. I will use `hnt-edit` to refactor `headlesh`'s `main.rs`, removing the `#[tokio::main]` macro and manually managing the Tokio runtime to ensure the forked child process can create its own clean runtime instance.
The `tokio::main` conflict should now be resolved. I'll compile `headlesh` and run a full integration test: create, list, exec, and exit to confirm stability.
The `headlesh` daemon is still failing due to a Tokio runtime issue in the forked process. The fix is to make the daemon's logic fully synchronous. I will use `hnt-edit` to refactor `run_daemon` to use `std` threads and blocking I/O, removing all Tokio dependencies from the forked code.
After extensive debugging, `headlesh` daemon logic is now fully synchronous. I am confident this is the correct approach. Now running the full `headlesh` integration test.
The `headlesh` integration test passed. The refactoring is complete. I will now remove the unused import from `headlesh/src/lib.rs`.
With the `headlesh` crate now stable, I'm resuming the `hnt-agent` implementation. I'll use `hnt-edit` to integrate `headlesh` session creation and a `Drop` guard for cleanup into `main.rs`.
User found a critical `headlesh` regression: shell state isn't persisting. My `run_daemon` refactor incorrectly spawns a new shell for each command. I will now refactor `run_daemon` to spawn a single, long-lived shell and pipe commands to its stdin, restoring state persistence.
The `headlesh` stateful functionality is restored. I'll remove the debug cruft, then run the full integration test to confirm the fix.
Debug code removed. Running final integration test to validate `headlesh` stability and correctness.
User correctly pointed out my proposed `headlesh` fix introduces a shell injection vulnerability. The temp file approach is correct for robustness; the bug is a race condition. I will stop and analyze the original C implementation of `headlesh` to understand the correct, safe way to execute commands before attempting another fix.
Understood the correct `headlesh` execution logic from the C implementation. The shell, not the server, must delete the temporary script. I will modify `run_daemon` in Rust to use `NamedTempFile::into_path()` and construct a one-liner command that sources the script, performs redirections, and then calls `rm -f` on the script path.
Understood the task. The 'headlesh' library has been refactored but is unstable. My first step is to attempt compilation of the headlesh crate, as instructed, and analyze any errors. I will not test manually.
Understood that headlesh is unstable after its refactor into a library. My immediate task is to get it to compile. Correcting the path to its source code and then proceeding with a build.
Compilation of headlesh failed due to an incorrect method name for NamedTempFile. Using hnt-edit to change `into_path()` to the correct `into_temp_path()`.
hnt-edit failed due to an incorrect relative path. I'm already in the 'rust' directory. Retrying the edit with the correct path 'bins/headlesh/src/lib.rs'.
User reports race condition in headlesh where temp script is deleted before execution. My previous fix was wrong. The correct fix is to use `std::mem::forget` on the TempPath guard to prevent Rust from deleting the file, leaving cleanup to the shell.
Applied the std::mem::forget fix for the headlesh race condition. Now recompiling and waiting for user to re-test.
headlesh is now confirmed to be working. Resuming hnt-agent implementation by adding headlesh and chrono as dependencies in its Cargo.toml.
Dependencies added to hnt-agent. Now implementing the session lifecycle management in src/main.rs. This includes creating a SessionGuard with a Drop trait to automatically start and stop the headlesh session.
Session management scaffolding for hnt-agent is complete. Compiling the binary now to verify the changes and new dependencies.
Compilation of hnt-agent failed due to a dependency error in hinata-core. The clap derive syntax for environment variables appears to be wrong. Reading the source file to correct it.
Identified incorrect clap 'env' attribute syntax in both hinata-core and hnt-agent crates. Using hnt-edit to apply the correct syntax to both files.
hnt-edit failed because the target string was not found in `hinata-core/src/llm.rs`. Following user advice to first re-read the file to get its current state before creating a more specific edit instruction.
Re-read the `hinata-core/src/llm.rs` file. The clap attribute formatting is incorrect. Instructing hnt-edit to fix the syntax.
Previous hnt-edit command failed due to a shell quoting error. Retrying the command with the instruction string enclosed in single quotes for safer parsing.
Applied clap syntax fix to hinata-core's llm.rs. Now, attempting to build hnt-agent again to verify the fix and the new session management code.
The fix for the clap 'env' attribute was incorrect. The fundamental syntax seems wrong. I'll consult the clap v4 documentation, re-read the file, and apply the correct syntax.
Web search confirms the 'clap' `env` feature is missing. Applying this fix to the Cargo.toml files for both hinata-core and hnt-agent, and correcting the attribute syntax in llm.rs.
hnt-agent now compiles with session management. The next step is to implement the core agent logic: getting system/user messages and creating the chat conversation.
Scaffolding for message handling and conversation creation in hnt-agent is complete. Now compiling to verify the new code.
hnt-agent compiles. Now implementing the main interaction loop. First step is to pack the conversation, send it to the LLM for one generation cycle, and print the response.
Added the one-time generation loop to hnt-agent. Compiling to verify logic and imports.
Compilation failed due to missing dependency and incorrect function calls in hnt-agent. Fixing Cargo.toml and correcting the implementation of the main loop to use LlmConfig and proper stream handling.
Compilation failed with a pinning error. The stream from the LLM is not 'Unpin'. Applying the fix by using `tokio::pin!` on the stream before the loop.
Applied `tokio::pin!` fix for the stream pinning error. Recompiling hnt-agent to verify.
Compilation failed due to a borrow checker error and an unused-mut warning. Fixing both issues in hnt-agent/src/main.rs by using 'ref' in the 'if let' pattern and removing the redundant 'mut'.
Applied fixes for borrow checker error (used `ref pattern`) and unused `mut` warning. Now recompiling hnt-agent.
hnt-agent compiles. Now implementing the interactive command-execution loop. First, adding the 'regex' crate as a dependency.
Added regex dependency. Now implementing the full interactive loop in hnt-agent: parse shell commands, execute them in the headlesh session, feed the output back into the conversation, and repeat.
Full interactive loop with command parsing and execution has been implemented. Compiling hnt-agent to verify the changes.
User reports hnt-agent exits silently. Suspecting an issue in async drop or silent error in exec. Refactoring SessionGuard's Drop to use a detached tokio::spawn task for cleanup, which is a more robust pattern than creating a new runtime.
Refactored the SessionGuard's Drop implementation to use `tokio::spawn`. Now compiling to verify the changes.
User pointed out that --help does nothing, confirming a fundamental startup issue. The headlesh session is being created before argument parsing, causing silent exits. I will restructure main() to parse args first.
Restructured hnt-agent's main function to parse CLI arguments before session creation. Now compiling to verify.
The agent now handles --help correctly but still exits silently on task execution. Adding extensive debug logging to trace the execution flow and pinpoint the silent error after argument parsing.
Added extensive debug logging to hnt-agent's main function. Compiling now to prepare for a test run to trace the execution flow.
Trace logs show a silent exit during `session.spawn()`. The `daemonize` call is the likely culprit. I will add verbose error handling to the `daemonize.start()` call in `headlesh` to expose the underlying issue.
Patched headlesh with improved error logging for daemonization. Recompiling, then will ask user to run the test command to capture the specific daemon error.
User reports that headlesh daemons are created but hnt-agent exits prematurely. This is a race condition where the parent process's SessionGuard kills the daemon before it initializes. Adding a small sleep after spawn to allow the daemon time to start.
Added a small sleep to `hnt-agent` to prevent a race condition during daemon startup. Compiling now to test the fix.
The race condition in headlesh is more fundamental than a simple sleep can fix, likely due to forking within an async context. 
Past report indicates a compile error in hnt-agent due to a sync/async mismatch with the refactored headlesh::spawn. My task is to remove the unnecessary .await call and recompile.
Compilation failed as predicted due to sync/async mismatch on headlesh::spawn. Using hnt-edit to remove the invalid .await call.
The .await call has been removed from session.spawn(). Now recompiling hnt-agent to verify the fix.
hnt-agent now compiles. Running a test command to verify the silent exit bug, caused by daemonization issues, is now resolved.
Reading all recommended files from the user's report to get context. My primary goal is to fix the sync/async compilation error in hnt-agent caused by the headlesh refactor.
The code already contains the 'await' removal mentioned in the user report. Proceeding to compile hnt-agent to verify the fix before requesting a test.
Compilation successful after fixing the sync/async conflict. Requesting user to perform an integration test to verify the silent exit bug is resolved.
hnt-agent test failed with a UTF-8 decoding error from the LLM stream. User suggests the issue is in hinata-core's LLM handling. I will investigate by comparing the Rust implementation in 'hinata-core/src/llm.rs' with the older C implementation in '/home/oboro/src/hinata/llm/'.
The path to the Rust LLM implementation was wrong. I will now list the contents of 'rust/crates/hinata-core/src' to find the correct file and debug the UTF-8 stream error by comparing it to the C implementation.
User instructed me to use 'fd' instead of 'ls -R'. I will use 'fd' to explore the 'rust' directory, find the 'hinata-core' source files, and then debug the UTF-8 stream issue.
I am pathfinding incorrectly. I will list the current directory to re-orient myself, then use the correct path to the 'rust' directory to find the 'hinata-core' source and debug the UTF-8 error.
I have re-oriented myself to the 'rust' directory. Now using 'fd' to locate the correct hinata-core source files to debug the LLM UTF-8 stream error.
Located the correct hinata-core source files. Reading llm.rs and lib.rs to compare with the C implementation and diagnose the UTF-8 stream error.
Identified the source of the UTF-8 error in hinata-core's stream handling. The Rust code prematurely converts raw byte chunks to strings. Refactoring llm.rs using hnt-edit to process the byte stream line-by-line, similar to the more robust C implementation.
The llm.rs stream processing logic has been refactored by hnt-edit to handle byte slices correctly. I will now recompile hnt-agent to integrate and verify the fix.
Following user instruction to perform a full `cargo build` to ensure all crates are compiled correctly after the stream handling fix. I will then request a re-test.
The full build failed due to a sync/async mismatch in the headlesh CLI, identical to the one previously fixed in hnt-agent. I will remove the '.await' from the spawn call in 'bins/headlesh/src/main.rs' and rebuild.
The async/sync conflict in the 'headlesh' binary is resolved. Now performing a full 'cargo build' to verify the entire workspace before requesting the final user test.
The UTF-8 error in hnt-llm persists despite my last fix. I'm stuck. I will use hnt-edit to add verbose byte-level logging to the 'stream_llm_response' function in 'llm.rs' to inspect the raw network stream and find the root cause of the error.
Debug logging added to trace raw LLM stream bytes. Now building the project with 'cargo build' before requesting a user test to capture the necessary data for diagnosing the persistent UTF-8 error.
The tracing build is complete. Requesting user to run 'hnt-llm' with 'RUST_LOG=trace' to capture the raw byte stream output and diagnose the UTF-8 error.
The trace logs didn't work because I forgot to initialize a logger in the hnt-llm binary. I will now examine its source and Cargo.toml to add a logging implementation like env_logger.
The hnt-llm binary had the env_logger dependency but was missing the initialization call. I will use hnt-edit to add 'env_logger::init();' to its main function to enable logging.
Logger initialization added. Rebuilding the project now to enable trace logging and diagnose the UTF-8 error.
Logs are still not appearing after adding logger initialization. I will now add a hardcoded eprintln! to the start of hnt-llm's main function to verify if my code changes are even being executed, which will help isolate the problem to either the logger configuration or a more fundamental build/execution issue.
The 'hnt-llm' binary is running but env_logger is not working. I will replace it with the 'simplelog' crate, which is already used in the 'headlesh' crate, to enable terminal logging.
Replacing env_logger with simplelog in hnt-llm. I will edit Cargo.toml to add simplelog and fern dependencies, and then edit main.rs to initialize a simplelog terminal logger, which should finally enable the trace output.
The logger has been swapped to simplelog. Building the project now, confident this will finally enable the trace output needed to diagnose the UTF-8 error.
The simplelog logger is configured. Requesting the user to run the 'hnt-llm' test with 'RUST_LOG=trace' to capture the raw byte stream and finally diagnose the UTF-8 error.
I can now test hnt-llm directly. Running the trace command to capture the raw byte stream and finally diagnose the persistent UTF-8 error.
The hnt-llm binary is running but logging is not working. The error must be happening before the network stream loop. I will now grep the entire project for the error string 'stream did not contain valid UTF-8' to find its origin.
The UTF-8 error is from a dependency and is propagating too quickly for logs to appear. I will refactor the stream-consuming loop in 'llm.rs' to explicitly match on the stream's Result, log any error found, and then propagate it. This should reveal the underlying issue.
Refactored stream error handling to log errors before exiting. Now building and running tests to capture the root cause of the stream issue.
The UTF-8 error is likely a reqwest error being propagated silently. I will modify stream_llm_response in hinata-core/src/llm.rs to explicitly match the result of the reqwest send call and log the error to make it visible.
Pathing error with hnt-edit. Moving into the 'rust' directory and retrying the edit on crates/hinata-core/src/llm.rs to expose the reqwest error.
hnt-edit failed because the target code was not found. I need to read the current content of crates/hinata-core/src/llm.rs to formulate a correct patch.
The logging I previously added to hinata-core is already present. The real issue must be that the hnt-llm binary is not initializing its logger correctly. I will now inspect bins/hnt-llm/src/main.rs to fix it.
The hnt-llm binary initializes a terminal logger, but it likely exits too fast for logs to flush. I will replace it with a CombinedLogger to write to both the terminal and /tmp/hnt-llm.log to ensure logs are captured.
Logger in hnt-llm has been updated to write to a file. Building the project now, then will re-run the failing command to capture the error log.
The previous edit caused a compilation error due to incorrect use of 'return' and '?' inside the stream macro. Fixing llm.rs to correctly 'yield' the error and then 'return' to stop the stream.
Compilation error in llm.rs fixed. Rebuilding the project to apply the patch.
Build successful. Running the test command now to trigger the error and checking the log file /tmp/hnt-llm.log for the root cause.
The file logger is not producing output, suggesting an early crash. I am adding log markers to the start and end of hnt-llm's main function to verify logger initialization and trace the execution flow.
Added start/end log markers. Rebuilding and running the test to see if the start marker appears in the log, which will confirm logger initialization.
The logger works, but the crash happens before my existing logs. The problem is likely in the unlogged HTTP error handling block. I am adding detailed logging there to see the status code and response body from the server.
Added detailed logging to the HTTP error handler. Rebuilding and running the test to capture the specific API error in the log file.
The bug is almost certainly a UTF-8 error from reading stdin before any network activity. I am modifying the 'generate' function to bypass stdin and use an empty string to confirm this hypothesis.
Bypassed stdin read. Building and running test to confirm if the UTF-8 error is gone and the API error is now logged, which will prove stdin was the source of the problem.
The UTF-8 error must be from the key management store. I will bypass it by setting the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable. This should make the UTF-8 error disappear and trigger the network error logging instead.
The user confirmed a conflict between C and Rust key files. I will now inspect 'crates/hinata-core/src/key_management.rs' to find the key store path definition so I can change it to a Rust-specific name.
Found the hardcoded 'keys' filename in key_management.rs. Changing it to 'keys.rust' in all occurrences to create a separate key store for the Rust tools.
User pointed out a second key file conflict. Renaming '.local_key' to '.local_key.rust' in key_management.rs to fully isolate the Rust key store.
All key paths are now rust-specific. Reverting the stdin bypass, then rebuilding. The UTF-8 error should be gone, and the invalid API key error should now be logged correctly.
Final test. Rebuilding and running the command to confirm all fixes work.
Cleaning up debug changes. Unsetting temp env var. Editing hnt-llm's main.rs to add a --debug-unsafe flag, move arg parsing up, and make logger initialization conditional on that flag.
Reverting verbose logging in hinata-core. Restoring the original, cleaner HTTP error handling.
Final cleanup step. Reverting the reqwest error logging in hinata-core's llm.rs to its original concise form.
Finalizing cleanup. Removing file logger from hnt-llm, leaving only a conditional terminal logger for debug mode. This restores original behavior.
All cleanup is complete. Performing a final build to verify the project is clean and the bug is resolved.
