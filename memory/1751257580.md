Starting the rewrite of './agent/headless/' Python code into Rust. My first step is to explore the Python code to understand its functionality.
FD failed because the path 'agent/headless/' was incorrect. I'll list the contents of the 'agent' directory to find the correct path.
Messed up the 'fd' command. The '-d' flag needs a number. Now, I'm listing files in the 'agent' directory to figure out its structure.
Found the 'agent/headlesh/' directory. I'll check out the C code inside to see how it works.
Analyzed the C code for `headlesh`. It's a client-server shell session manager using FIFOs. Now, I'll inspect the existing Rust project in ./rust to see how to best integrate this functionality.
Setting up a new Rust binary crate 'headlesh' to replicate the C version's functionality. First step: create the directory structure and scaffolding for the new crate.
Populating the new 'headlesh' crate. I'll configure Cargo.toml with necessary dependencies like clap and tokio, then set up the basic CLI structure in main.rs using clap.
The agent's initial setup is good, but I need to fix some errors. I'm correcting the binary name in Cargo.toml and will then fix the command-line arguments in main.rs.
Package name fixed. Now, I'm updating 'main.rs' to make 'session_id' a required positional argument for the 'create', 'exec', and 'exit' commands.
CLI arguments are fixed. Now, I'll add the 'headlesh' crate to the workspace and compile to verify the setup.
Adding 'bins/headlesh' to the workspace members in the root Cargo.toml.
Added 'headlesh' to the workspace. Compiling the project now to check for errors and to cache the new dependencies.
Starting implementation of the 'list' subcommand. I will add logic to read session directories, parse PID files, and check for active processes. This will establish the foundation for session management.
hnt-edit failed due to an incorrect path. I was in the 'rust' directory but provided a path from the project root. I will now re-run the command with the correct relative path.
Testing the newly implemented 'list' command. I expect it to run without error and produce no output, as there are no active sessions yet.
Compilation failed because of missing 'nix' features. I'm adding the 'signal' and 'process' features to the 'headlesh' crate's Cargo.toml to resolve this.
Enabled necessary 'nix' features. Retrying the compile and run of the 'list' command.
Starting implementation of the 'create' command. My first step is to handle session directory creation, file locking, and daemonization. I'll add placeholders for the FIFO and shell logic.
The 'create' command scaffold is good, but I need to add the missing dependencies: 'fslock', 'simplelog', and 'dirs' to Cargo.toml.
Dependencies added. Now testing 'create' command by creating 'test-session', verifying with 'list', and checking the log file.
Correcting compilation errors. First, adding the 'log' crate to Cargo.toml.
Adding the 'log' dependency didn't fix everything. Now I'm fixing compiler errors in main.rs by correcting the LockFile::open call and reordering the file handling to open with std::fs::File before locking with fslock to write the PID.
The agent messed up the 'try_lock' call. I'm fixing it to the simpler, correct 'lock.try_lock().is_err()' and removing the unnecessary prelude use statement.
Code corrected. I'm now compiling and running the 'create' command, expecting it to succeed.
Switching from 'fslock' to 'fs2' for file locking to allow writing to the locked PID file. I will update Cargo.toml and main.rs to implement this change.
Replaced 'fslock' with 'fs2'. Now compiling and testing the 'create' command again.
Session 'test-session' is up and running. Now, I'm checking the logs to verify everything's working as expected.
Log file confirmed. Implementing 'exit' command now to stop test sessions. I'll read the PID from the lock file and send a SIGTERM signal.
Testing the newly implemented 'exit' command on 'test-session'. I will use 'list' to verify termination and confirm the session directory is gone.
The 'exit' command works, but it's not cleaning up the session directory. I'll add a SIGTERM handler to the daemon to remove the directory and pid.lock file upon exit, using the 'signal-hook' crate. First step is to add the new dependency to Cargo.toml.
With 'signal-hook' added, I'm implementing signal handling for the 'create' command. I'll import from `signal_hook`, register a SIGTERM handler to log shutdown and remove the session directory, and then modify the daemon's loop to use an atomic boolean flag controlled by the signal handler for a clean exit.
Testing the full create-exit-cleanup lifecycle. I'll create 'test-cleanup', confirm it's running, exit it, and then verify its session directory is gone.
The test-cleanup directory wasn't removed because my signal handler was blocked. I'll switch the main loop to use signals.forever() to fix this.
Signal handling logic is cleaner. Retesting to confirm cleanup works.
The test-cleanup directory wasn't deleted. The daemon might be taking too long to shut down, so I'm checking the logs to debug.
Signal received, cleanup started, but directory deletion failed. Suspecting a lingering file lock on pid.lock, I'll explicitly drop the File object before attempting to remove the directory, ensuring the lock is released.
Lock's now explicitly released. Retrying the test, confident the directory will be removed.
User pointed out my error; cleanup is working. Now implementing the server-side 'exec' logic within the 'create' command: creating cmd.fifo, spawning the shell, and setting the main loop to read from the FIFO.
New code added a lot of complexity. I'm adding a missing 'use' statement for 'nix::sys::stat'.
The agent was right, nix::sys::stat was already there. My mistake. The consolidation is a good cleanup. Now, before I can test this new server logic, I need a client that can send a message. I will implement the client-side logic of the 'exec' command. My plan for the 'exec' command is to: read the command script from stdin, construct the path to the session's 'cmd.fifo', open the FIFO for writing, write the script to the FIFO, and for now, I will ignore the response FIFOs and just send the command.
With the basic 'exec' command ready, I'll test the full communication flow: create 'test-exec', send it a command, check the logs for reception, and then exit to clean up.
