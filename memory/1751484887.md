Starting task: modify hnt-agent to use a TUI pane for user input. First, I will explore the codebase.
Exploring `hnt-agent` to find where it handles user input and argument parsing.
Starting to investigate how hnt-agent invokes the editor. I will search for relevant keywords in bins/hnt-agent.
Found the editor invocation in `get_input_from_editor` in `bins/hnt-agent/src/main.rs`. Now checking for arg parser and `hnt-tui pane` usage.
Confirmed clap is used. Now checking 'hnt-tui pane' help before modifying hnt-agent to add the --use-pane flag and conditional editor invocation.
Ready to modify hnt-agent. I will use hnt-edit to add the --use-pane flag and modify get_input_from_editor to use `hnt-tui pane` when the flag is active.
Code has been modified by hnt-edit. Now building the project to verify the changes.
User requested not to use build.sh. Running 'cargo build' instead to verify compilation after the recent changes.
Explaining Rust workspace conventions (bins/ vs crates/) to the user. Will show the top-level Cargo.toml to illustrate.
User wants to flatten src/ directories. I will investigate headlesh/Cargo.toml and its file structure to explain the implications.
User has approved the project flattening. I will now proceed with moving packages from bins/ and crates/ to the root, renaming hinata-core, and updating all necessary Cargo.toml files.
Refactoring is done. Now verifying the changes by checking the main Cargo.toml and running 'cargo check' on the entire workspace.
The refactoring caused a build error. My previous `sed` command to update dependency paths failed. I will now inspect `hnt-agent/Cargo.toml` to diagnose the issue and create a new command to fix it.
The previous path fix was incomplete. Sibling dependencies also have incorrect paths. I will use hnt-edit to correct all local dependency paths in every Cargo.toml file in the workspace.
Previous hnt-edit failed due to an incorrect fd command. I am now correcting the file search and clarifying the instructions to fix the broken dependency paths in all Cargo.toml files.
Previous attempts to fix paths with hnt-edit failed due to incorrect file searching. I am now using a more reliable `find` command and a focused prompt to correct only the broken `hinata-core` dependency path.
The dependency paths have been corrected by hnt-edit. I will now run 'cargo check' again to finally verify the refactoring.
User wants to fix `hnt-chat gen` to correctly handle LLM reasoning. I'll start by examining the `hnt-chat` source code.
Investigating `hnt-chat/src/main.rs`. I will search for the 'gen' subcommand logic to find where `hnt-llm` is called and how its output is processed.
Confirmed logic is in `handle_gen_command`. Now inspecting its implementation in `hnt-chat/src/main.rs` to find the incorrect handling of `hnt-llm` output.
Identified that the stream processing logic in `handle_gen_command` is likely faulty. I will now examine the entire function to understand how the LLM output stream is consumed.
Identified incorrect stdout writing in `handle_gen_command`. I will use hnt-edit to remove the stdout writing from the `LlmStreamEvent::Reasoning` match arm.
The fix for hnt-chat has been applied. I am now running `cargo check` to verify the code's integrity.
User corrected my previous work. The goal is to add an --include-reasoning flag to `hnt-chat gen` and properly wrap the streamed reasoning output in <think> tags on the console. I will now use hnt-edit to implement this.
The hnt-edit agent has applied the reasoning-handling logic. I will now run `cargo check` to verify the new code.
User needs <think> tags in the output files, not just the console. I will use hnt-edit to modify the file-writing logic in `handle_gen_command` to include these tags.
The file-writing logic has been updated to include <think> tags. I'm running `cargo check` to verify the final changes.
User reports that reasoning is not being discarded correctly. I will now add a condition to the `LlmStreamEvent::Reasoning` match arm to completely ignore the event if no reasoning flags are active.
The reasoning event handler is now correctly conditional. Running `cargo check` to verify the final state of the code.
User wants to change the temp file format in `hnt-agent`. I will now inspect `get_input_from_editor` in `hnt-agent/src/main.rs` to find the current filename generation logic.
Identified the temp file naming logic in `hnt-agent`. I will now use hnt-edit to change the file extension from .txt to .md and remove the '-msg' part of the name.
The temp file format for hnt-agent has been updated. Running `cargo check` for verification.
